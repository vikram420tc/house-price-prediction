# 🏠 House Price Prediction Using Smart Regression Techniques

## 📄 Project Overview

Buying a house is one of the most significant financial decisions in a person's life. However, traditional methods of estimating property value can be inconsistent and error-prone. This project aims to use data science and smart regression techniques to forecast house prices accurately, benefiting buyers, sellers, agents, and financial institutions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the impact of various factors (e.g., location, area, number of rooms) on house prices.
- Apply and compare multiple regression algorithms.
- Identify the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
- Use EDA techniques to uncover insights.
- Engineer features to improve model accuracy.
- Visualize important features and model behavior.
- *(Optional)* Deploy a web interface for user-friendly predictions.
